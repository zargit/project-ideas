Watch this [YouTube video]() to know how to build a simple dictionary using Trie Tree.

### Project Requirement:
- - - -
* The dictionary must contain both words and its meaning.
* The dictionary must support **adding new words with its meaning**, **searching an existing word**, **updating the meaning of an existing word** and **deleting an existing word**.
*  The data must be persistent, meaning that when the program is closed the data is not lost, we should be able view that once we start the program again.
* Allowed languages
	* C++, Java
	* Python
	* Other (inform first)
* Project report:
	* Mention in detail about any extra features you added, if any.
	* Must include detail explanation of your algorithms.
	* Must include short description of all major functions/classes.
	* Must include detail of the data storage scheme.
