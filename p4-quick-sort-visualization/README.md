# Quick Sort Visualization
- - - - 
Sorting is one of the fundamental algorithms in computer science, there are different kinds of sorting algorithms with variying efficiency and time complexity. Among those Quick Sort is one of the best with a time complexity of O(n^2). Though its time complexity is O(n^2), in practical its better than Merge Sort. Heres couple of picture showing sorting visulaizaton -
